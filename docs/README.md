# Developer Documentation

## Getting set up

 * Use node v10.7.0 (or whatever the lowest engine is in the root package.json)
 * `git clone git@github.com:trufflesuite/ganache-core.git`
 * `cd ganache-core`
 * `npm install`

## Clean install

 * `npm run clean`
 * `npm install`

## VSCode On Windows (10)

 * Enable "Developer Mode" by going to Settings -> Developer Settings -> Then select Developer Mode.

## To build

Builds all packages:

 * `npm run tsc`

## To test

Runs all tests:

 * `npm test`

## To create a new package

 * `npm run create <name>`

This will create a new package with Ganache defaults at `src/packages/<name>`.

## To add a module to a package:

 * `npx lerna add <module>[@version] -E [--dev] [--peer] --scope=<package>`

Where `<module>` is the npm-module you want to add and `<package>` is where you want to add it. See 
[@lerna/add documentation](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/add) for more details.

Example:

```bash
npx lerna add @ganache/options -E --scope=@ganache/filecoin
```

will add our local `@ganache/options` package to the `@ganache/filecoin` package.

## To remove a module from another package:

`cd` to the package and then run `npm uninstall <module>`

## To debug tests in VS Code

 * Copy the [`launch.json`](./launch.json) file into a folder named `.vscode` in root of the project.
 * Set breakpoints by clicking the margin to the left of the line numbers (you can set conditional breakpoints or 
 logpoints by right-clicking instead)
 * Press <kbd>F5</kbd> (or select `Run` ðŸ¡º `Start Debugging` from the menu bar) to automatically start debugging.

To change which files are debugged update your `.vscode/launch.json` file glob to match your target files. Here is an 
example to debug only test files in the ethereum package:

```diff
diff --git a/.vscode/launch.json b/.vscode/launch.json

## Code Conventions

These are guidelines, not rules. :-)

 * Use Node v10.7.0 for most local development. This is the earliest version we support.
 * Use `bigint` literals, e.g., `123n`; if the number is externally configurable and/or could exceed
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.
 * Write tests.
 * Do not use "Optional Chaining" (`obj?.prop`). I'd love to enable this, but TypeScript makes it hard to use bigint
  literals and optional chaining together.
 * Prefer using a single loop to functional chaining.
 * Prefer performant code over your own developer experience.
 * Document complex code. Explain why the code does what it does.
 * Feel free to be clever, just document _why_ you're being clever. If it's hard to read, comment _what_ the code does,
  too.
 * Add JSDoc comments to public class members where it makes sense.
 * Before adding an external dependency check its code for quality, its # of external dependencies, its node version
  support, and make sure it absolutely necessary.
 * Pin all dependencies, even dev dependencies.
 * Use npm; do not use yarn.
 * Don't use web3, ethers, etc in ganache-core core code. (Tests are fine)
 * Ensure a smooth development experience on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
 * Do not use bash scripts.
 * Do not use CLI commands in npm scripts or build scripts that aren't available by default on supported platforms.
 * Push your code often (at least every-other day!), even broken WIP code (to your own branch, of course).
